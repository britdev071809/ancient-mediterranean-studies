# Phaistos Disc

**Origin:** Phaistos, Crete (Minoan)
**Date:** c. 1850–1600 BCE (Middle Minoan III)
**Materials:** Baked clay, stamped symbols
**Cultural Context:** Minoan civilization, possibly a religious, administrative, or gaming artifact.

## Description of Motifs

The Phaistos Disc is a round clay tablet bearing a spiral of 242 stamped symbols, representing 45 distinct pictographs. Among these pictographs is a clear depiction of an **octopus** (symbol #24 in many catalogues). The octopus is shown with a rounded head and eight tentacles, each ending in small suction cups. The style is highly schematic but retains the essential marine characteristics.

Other symbols include human figures, ships, shields, plants, and geometric shapes. The octopus appears multiple times along the spiral, suggesting it may carry a specific phonetic or ideographic value.

## Artistic Style

- **Form:** The octopus pictograph is simplified to a central oval with eight radiating lines. The stamp technique produces a uniform, repetitive impression.
- **Context:** The disc’s purpose remains debated—possible uses include a prayer, a board game, a calendar, or a diplomatic message. The inclusion of marine motifs like the octopus underscores the Minoan connection to the sea.

## Significance

The octopus on the Phaistos Disc is one of the earliest standardized representations of this marine creature in the Aegean. Its presence among other symbols may indicate a logographic or syllabic sign related to maritime activities, trade, or a deity associated with the sea.
