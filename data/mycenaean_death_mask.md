# Mycenaean Gold Death Mask

**Origin:** Grave Circle A, Mycenae (Mycenaean)
**Date:** c. 1600–1500 BCE (Late Helladic I)
**Materials:** Hammered gold sheet
**Cultural Context:** Mycenaean warrior aristocracy, funerary ritual.

## Description of Motifs

The so-called "Mask of Agamemnon" (one of several gold death masks from Grave Circle A) depicts a bearded male face with carefully rendered facial features—arched eyebrows, narrow eyes, a prominent nose, and a thin mouth. The mask is purely anthropomorphic and contains **no marine or octopus imagery**. Its decorative elements are limited to the stylized rendering of hair and beard, indicated by incised lines.

## Artistic Style

- **Form:** The mask is a three-dimensional repoussé work, molded to fit over the face of the deceased. The expression is serene and idealized.
- **Context:** Placed over the face of a high-status male burial, the mask likely served to preserve the likeness of the deceased and signify his elite status in the afterlife.

## Significance

While the death mask itself does not incorporate the octopus motif, its existence alongside other Mycenaean luxury goods demonstrates the wealth and artistic sophistication of the Mycenaean palatial culture. The absence of marine motifs in this funerary context may reflect a different symbolic repertoire (warrior identity, ancestral worship) compared to the marine‑themed pottery used in everyday and ceremonial settings.
