# Mycenaean Octopus Stirrup Jar

**Origin:** Tiryns, Argolid (Mycenaean)
**Date:** c. 1400–1300 BCE (Late Helladic IIIB)
**Materials:** Wheel‑made pottery, dark‑on‑light painted decoration
**Cultural Context:** Mycenaean palatial period, used for storage and transport of oil or wine.

## Description of Motifs

The stirrup jar (so‑called because of its false spout and handles resembling a stirrup) is decorated with a large, sprawling octopus that covers the vessel’s shoulder and body. The octopus is painted in a dark brown/black slip on the buff‑colored clay. Its body is a central oval from which eight long, looping tentacles radiate, each tentacle adorned with rows of small circles representing suction cups. The tentacles interlace with abstract seaweed or wave patterns, creating a dense, all‑over design.

## Artistic Style

- **Form:** The octopus is more schematic and geometric than its Minoan counterparts. The tentacles are often arranged in symmetric, repeating loops, giving the motif a more regimented, “filling‑the‑field” appearance.
- **Movement:** While still dynamic, the Mycenaean octopus lacks the fluid, naturalistic motion of Minoan marine‑style depictions. The composition is more controlled and repetitive, reflecting the Mycenaean tendency toward order and symmetry.
- **Context:** Such jars were widely traded across the eastern Mediterranean; the octopus motif may have served both decorative and symbolic functions, perhaps evoking maritime power or the wealth of seaborne trade.

## Significance

The octopus on Mycenaean pottery represents a clear adoption (and adaptation) of a Minoan marine motif. The stylistic shift toward greater abstraction and symmetry suggests a reinterpretation that aligns with Mycenaean aesthetic preferences and possibly different cultural associations—less about the sea’s fertility and more about control, storage, and elite display.
