# Knossos Palace Fresco: Marine Style Octopus Motif

**Origin:** Palace of Knossos, Crete (Minoan)
**Date:** c. 1500–1450 BCE (Late Minoan I)
**Materials:** Fresco (pigment on wet plaster)
**Cultural Context:** Minoan civilization, possibly associated with religious or palatial decoration.

## Description of Motifs

The fresco fragment from the Palace of Knossos depicts a highly stylized octopus rendered in the "Marine Style" characteristic of Late Minoan pottery and wall painting. The octopus is shown with a rounded body and eight long, sinuous tentacles that curl and intertwine with surrounding marine elements—seaweed, coral, and perhaps small fish. The tentacles are articulated with suction cups indicated by small circles. The overall composition is fluid and dynamic, conveying a sense of underwater movement.

## Artistic Style

- **Form:** The octopus body is centrally placed, with tentacles extending outward in a radial pattern. The lines are curvilinear and organic, emphasizing natural motion.
- **Color:** The original pigments have faded, but traces of dark blue (likely Egyptian blue) and red ochre suggest a polychrome scheme.
- **Context:** The fresco likely adorned a corridor or room in the palatial complex, reflecting the Minoan fascination with marine life and their close relationship with the sea.

## Significance

The octopus motif in Minoan art is often interpreted as a symbol of the sea's fertility and abundance, possibly linked to religious beliefs about marine deities or the underworld. Its appearance in a palatial setting underscores the importance of maritime trade and cultural identity for the Minoans.
